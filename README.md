# Kaggle Whale Identification via Local-feature Based Image Retrieval

## Local Feature Extraction

We use the local feature with up-right orientation assumption as the whale image is upright (the sky on the top).
The [hesaff](https://github.com/perdoch/hesaff) is used for feature extraction.
To faciliate the batch extraction, the *batch_extract_whale_test.py* and *batch_extract_whale_train.py* in /code directory.
